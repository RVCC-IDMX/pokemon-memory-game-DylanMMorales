## 🧩 Game Implementation

The memory game is built using a feature branch workflow, with each game feature implemented incrementally:

1. **Create Pokémon Pairs**: Fetch and create pairs of identical Pokémon cards
2. **Track Card Selections**: Implement logic to track first and second card selections
3. **Match Detection**: Check if selected cards show the same Pokémon
4. **Game Completion**: Detect when all pairs have been found and show completion message
5. **Code Cleanup**: Refactor and optimize the codebase

## 🔄 API Usage

This game uses the free [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pokémon data. The API provides sprites, names, types, and other Pokémon information that we use to create the game cards.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The game is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: 4x3 grid for comfortable play
- **Tablet**: 3x4 grid with adjusted card sizes
- **Mobile**: 2x6 grid with optimized touch targets

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned features for future updates:
- Score tracking based on moves and time
- Difficulty levels (more pairs, shorter display time)
- Sound effects and background music
- Theme selection (filter by Pokémon type or generation)
- Local leaderboard using localStorage
